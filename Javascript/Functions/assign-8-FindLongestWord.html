    <!-- The findLongestWord function splits the input sentence into an array of words using split(' ').

The findLongest helper function is used to find the longest word using recursion. It pops words from the array one by one and compares their length to the current longest word. It continues this process until all words have been checked.

The result is the longest word found during the recursion. -->
