    <!-- We define the calculateTax function, which takes income (income amount in dollars) and taxRate (tax rate as a percentage) as parameters.

We check if income and taxRate are non-negative. If either of them is negative, we return an error message.

We calculate the tax amount by multiplying income by the taxRate (converted to a decimal by dividing by 100).

Finally, we return the calculated tax amount. -->
