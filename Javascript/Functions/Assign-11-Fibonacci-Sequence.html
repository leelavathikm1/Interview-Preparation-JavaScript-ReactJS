      const numberOfTerms = 10;
      const fibonacciSequence = generateFibonacci(numberOfTerms);

    <!-- The generateFibonacci function uses recursion to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

The function takes four parameters:

n: The number of terms to generate.
current: The current term in the sequence.
next: The next term in the sequence.
result: An array to store the generated sequence.
The base case is when n reaches 0, at which point the function returns the result array.

In each recursive call, the function appends the current term to the result array and then calls itself with n decremented by 1, next as the new current, and current + next as the new next.

This approach generates the Fibonacci sequence without explicit loops or conditions, relying on recursion to calculate the sequence. -->
